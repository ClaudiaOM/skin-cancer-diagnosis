# Abstract
The incidence of skin cancer cases increases considerably every year. Cuba is not exempt from this growth being this type of cancer the most reported in 2020.
Within these malignant skin tumors there are different classifications such as Melanoma and Non Melanoma skin cancer, the latter includes Basal Cell Carcinoma and
Spinocellular Carcinoma. For its early detection, a non-invasive technique called  dermoscopy is used to visualize deep cutaneous structures not detectable with the
naked eye. Like any other technique, dermoscopy requires a learning period for which numerous methods have been designed. It happens that depending on the
experience of the specialists, some patterns are more difficult to differentiate.

This thesis proposes an ensemble of neural networks to classify a dermoscopy image into four classes: melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma
and others. As part of this strategy, the technique of transfer learning was employed in three neural networks; VGG16, ResNet50 and EfficientNet B0. Different
fusion techniques were experimented that achieved a small increase in the number of cases identified. This work constitutes a first approach to a system to assist the
diagnosic aid to be used by dermatologists.
